# Next Steps for Jon

## Some Little Challenges

Try to do these without depending too much on AI. Or think of what you might do but then use AI to validate your thoughts on what you'll do or to provide clarity.

1. Create a new User, `michael`, and give it Read-Only Permissions
    - This User will _eventually_ probably have more access than the `Read-Only` User Group so add it to a new one - `Collaborators` which, for now, only has the same `ReadOnlyAccess` Policy attached
    - Ensure there is a default password for the user. You can send this to me when it's time to login
    - Ensure the user is required to set their own password on initial sign in
2. Add me to your Trello Board as a Collaborator. I haven't looked at this in a while but you can figure it out. I'd like to be able to add/modify tasks on the board
3. Create a new GitHub Repo for any existing scripts you have _(like your RuneScape stuff)_. You can call it something like `RecreationalScripts`. All GitHub Repositories should have a README so be sure to create one that explains that the Repository is for.
    - This is written in Markdown and GitHub renders it cleanly. Rather than Vim, you're better off learning Markdown (Obsidian is perfect for this because that's all it is)
    - This page _is_ a Markdown File. Click on `Raw` to see what it actually looks like
4. Share your GitHub page with me so I can Star it and follow it. Mine is the one you're in while you read this.

## Next Steps

Do all the other stuff and then start working on Comptia (the last section).

### Your Life Now

Before you do anything else, figure out what your plan is. Are you going to do 9-5 Mon-Fri? Something else? Whatever you do, with the best intention for yourself (keeping in mind your job, exercise, and recreation), come up with a "work" schedule and stick to it. Add it to your Calendar even.

### Resume

Just be ready to start doing stuff here. Don't worry about doing anything yet. Just start thinking about the fact that you'll need to and that may help frame everything you're doing.

### Obsidian

Obsidian is really really powerful. Spend some time getting used to Markdown so this can be a super helpful tool. Markdown is a general markup language that's basically a super simple HTML. [Check this out for some idea about it](https://help.obsidian.md/syntax). Create a note and play around with this.

After you play around a bit, I recommend looking into some Plugins that may make your life easier with it. [This page seems to go into some recommendations](https://www.dsebastien.net/2022-10-19-the-must-have-obsidian-plugins/). Some that stand out to me:

- Calendar might be nice
- Dataview is super nifty but you may hold off on it. Just know it exists and what it does
- Templater is wonderful. I'd install it and try it out.
- I use Homepage
- Kanban can technically replace Trello for you which is cool. I'd probably not use it though since we can collab on Trello
- Paste Image Renamer - I didn't know this existed so getting this asap
- Various Complements
- Tasks
- Excalidraw is awesome
- I could see using Obsidian Git. I use Obsidian Sync which is paid.
- I use Admonitions a lot
- I though Obsidian already had Syntax Highlighting but maybe not. So I'd get Syntax Highlight

> Also you can enable Vim here so you can learn both simultaneously!

### Git

Next you wanna spend some time learning about Git. There's a super high ceiling here but you should know the basics.

**Placeholder:** I'll add more here but, for now, just use ChatGPT and the Google and get some idea. I would _highly_ recommend creating a Repository and pushing/pulling/etc some stuff for practice.

### COMPTIA

You should get back on this horse ASAP
